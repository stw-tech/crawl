From 2000 until 2005, he was a Member of the Technical Staff with the Advanced Photonics Research Department, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies, where he invented and headed the research and development efforts of MEMS-based wavelength-selective switching solutions for optical networks. Since 2005, he has been with the Applied Physics Department, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where he is currently serving as Department Chair and leads the Photonics Devices group. His research interests include creating photonic devices and sub-systems for switching and manipulating optical signals in guided-wave and free-space optics solutions using light modulating devices, nonlinear optics, and compound materials.",

He was the recipient of the IEEE Photonics Society Distinguished Lecturer Award in 2014 and 2015. From 1996 to 2000, he was a Fannie and John Hertz Foundation Graduate Fellow with UCSD, and was a Peter Brojde Scholar in 2006\u20132007. He was one of two Senior Editors for Photonics Technology Letters, handling all photonic-device-related submissions. He serves as Steering Committee Chair for the International Conference on Optical MEMS and Nanophotonics."

    "abstract":"Wavelength demultiplexers are instrumental in wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) communications. In advance of space-division multiplexing (SDM) WDM communications, we investigate wavelength multiplexer/demultiplexer designs operating over multiplexed spatial modes simultaneously, when the modes are arranged along one transverse direction of a rectangular waveguide. The demultiplexer waveguides' modes match those of rectangular core fibers, enabling simple and efficient edge-coupling. We describe the challenge of demultiplexing mode division multiplexed (MDM) channels, and suggest guided optics solutions for its implementation. We analyze the spatial-spectral interplay at output waveguide coupling due to mode dependent phase delays in arrayed waveguide grating router demultiplexer design, and offer low mode dependent loss solutions. The proposed schemes allow for efficient and compact MDM-enabled WDM multiplexing, paving the way to SDM-WDM communication networks.",
